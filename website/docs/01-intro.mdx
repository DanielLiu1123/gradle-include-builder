# Introduction

Gradle Include Builder is a script that aims to use source code of the dependencies to build gradle project,
keep the code always updated, and make customization and extension easier.

## Challenges of Jar Dependencies

- Setting up and maintaining a private repository

    This is time-consuming and requires extra costs and expertise.
    Managing the stability and security of a private repository adds complexity to the project,
    and any disruption can affect dependency management and the build process.

- Updates are not timely

    Relying on jar files means waiting for the library author to release a new version.
    This can cause unnecessary delays for urgent bug fixes or security updates.

- Difficult to debug and troubleshoot

    Without the source code, it becomes harder to understand and debug issues in the dependency library.
    Even with source code, you cannot make direct modifications in the project,
    limiting your ability to quickly resolve issues.

- Inconvenient to customize and extend

    When you need to customize or extend library functions, starting from the source
    code to compile and manage your own version is troublesome and prone to errors.
    Merging these changes with library updates is even more challenging.

In enterprise projects, we often divide our code into several independently functional modules.
Relying on traditional jar dependencies makes it extremely difficult to ensure these modules' code is always up-to-date.
Once a dependent module encounters an issue, quick fixes become even more challenging since directly modifying
the source code of dependencies is very difficult.

## Source Code Dependencies

Imagine a scenario where our dependencies are directly on source code, not jar files.
What significant advantages could we gain?

- Enhanced Extensibility and Customization

    Direct access to the source code provides unparalleled flexibility for the project,
    making it straightforward to extend functionalities and customize features.

- Rapid Issue Resolution

    Being able to immediately access and modify the source code greatly reduces the time for diagnosing and solving problems.

- Instant Updates

    Relying on source code means any modifications or updates to the libraries can be reflected in the project instantly,
    ensuring the project is always up-to-date.

## Limitations

The primary challenge of using source code dependencies is the increased build time,
as dependencies are based on .java files instead of .class files,
meaning the source code of the dependencies must be compiled.
Therefore, it may not be a good choice to use source code dependencies for large projects like [Spring](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework),
as their build and compilation time could significantly increase.

However, if your team is utilizing Gradle and managing multiple modules or repositories,
considering a source code dependency approach is advisable.
This method can significantly enhance the efficiency of code iterations,
especially during development and testing phases, allowing immediate visibility of changes.
