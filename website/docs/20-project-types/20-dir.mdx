# Directory

This section describes how to use a **directory** as a dependency.

## Basic

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
projects:
  - dir:
      path: ../dir # path to the directory, can be relative or absolute path
      buildPath: . # build path, default is '.', means the same directory as the '.projects[].dir.path'
```

See [dir example](https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/gradle-include-builder/tree/main/examples/dir).
