# Git Repository

This section describes how to use a **Git repository** as a dependency.

## Basic

If the `path` directory does not exist, the remote repository will be cloned to the specified directory.

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
projects:
  - id: httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      branch: main
      path: third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
```

## Use the Same Branch

It is possible to configure the git repository
to try to use the same branch and use the default branch if the branch does not exist.

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
trySameBranch: true # default is false
projects:
  - id: httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      branch: main
      path: third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      trySameBranch: true # override the global configuration
  - id: grpc-starter
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/grpc-starter
      branch: main
      path: third-party/grpc-starter
      trySameBranch: false
```

## Branch Mapping

If you currently work on branch `feat-x`, and want this branch to depend on the specified branch of git repository,
you can use `branchMappingDir` configuration.

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
branchMappingDir: .branch-mappings # default is .branch-mappings
projects:
  - id: httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      branch: main
      path: third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
  - id: grpc-starter
    git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/grpc-starter
      path: third-party/grpc-starter
```

Now, you can create file `feat-x.yaml` (`<branch>.yaml`) in the `.branch-mappings` directory to map the current branch to the specified branch.

```yaml title=".branch-mappings/feat-x.yaml"
mappings:
  - id: httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
    branch: 3.2.x # This will override '.projects[].git.branch' configuration in the include-builder.yaml
  - id: grpc-starter
    branch: main
```

## Build Path

The build path may not always be the root dir and can be specified via the `buildPath` configuration.

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
projects:
  - git:
      url: https://github.com/xxx/multi-module-project
      buildPath: ./java-module # default is root dir (.)
```

## Extra Args

You can pass extra arguments to the `git clone` command.

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
projects:
  - git:
      url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      path: third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
      extraArgs: --depth 1 --single-branch --no-tags
```
