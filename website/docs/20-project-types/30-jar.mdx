# Jar File

This section describes how to use a **Jar file** as a dependency.

## Basic

```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
projects:
  - jar:
      url: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.10.1/gson-2.10.1.jar
      path: libs/gson.jar
      downloadPolicy: IF_NOT_PRESENT
```

`.properties[].jar.downloadPolicy` has three options:

- `ALWAYS`: Always download the jar file.
- `IF_NOT_PRESENT`: Download the jar file only if it does not exist, this is the default value.
- `NEVER`: Never download the jar file.

:::note
`downloadPolicy` is case-sensitive.

See [jar example](https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/gradle-include-builder/tree/main/examples/jar).
