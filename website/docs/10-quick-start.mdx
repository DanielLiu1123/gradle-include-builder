# Quick Start

1. Apply the script

    ```groovy title="settings.gradle"
    apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielLiu1123/gradle-include-builder/main/include-build.gradle'
    ```

2. Add dependencies

    ```yaml title="include-builder.yaml"
    projects:
      - id: httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
        git:
          url: https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
          branch: main
          path: third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter
    ```

3. Use the included project

    ```groovy title="build.gradle"
    implementation 'io.github.danielliu1123:httpexchange-spring-boot-starter'
    ```

:::warning
After testing, if the dependent project uses the [`io.spring.dependency-management`](https://docs.spring.io/dependency-management-plugin/docs/current/reference/html/) plugin,
Then you also need to add the plug-in in the root project, otherwise the build may go wrong.
