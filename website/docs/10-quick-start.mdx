# Quick Start

1. Apply the script in the `settings.gradle`

    ```groovy title="settings.gradle"
    apply from: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielLiu1123/gradle-include-builder/refs/heads/main/include-builder.gradle"
    ```

2. Add dependencies in the `include-builder.json`

    ```yaml title="include-builder.json"
    {
      "dependencies": [
        {
          "path": "third-party/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter",
          "git": {
            "url": "https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter",
            "branch": "main"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. Use the included project

    ```groovy title="build.gradle"
    // <group>:<artifact> format, do NOT specify the version
    implementation 'io.github.danielliu1123:httpexchange-spring-boot-starter'
    ```

:::warning
After testing, if the dependent project uses the [`io.spring.dependency-management`](https://docs.spring.io/dependency-management-plugin/docs/current/reference/html/) plugin,
Then you also need to add the plug-in in the root project, otherwise the build may go wrong.
